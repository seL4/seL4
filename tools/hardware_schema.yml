      Use interrupt associated with the seL4,boot-cpu set in the chosen node.
      For instance, a chosen node like

      chosen {
        seL4,boot-cpu = <&cpu2>;
      }

      and a device like

      device {
        interrupts = <0x1 0x2 0x3 0x4>;
        interrupt-affinity = <&cpu0 &cpu1 &cpu2 &cpu3>;
      }

      would use interrupt 0x3 if the boot-cpu option was used as the index.
    pattern: '^boot-cpu$'
