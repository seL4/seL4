8.0.0 2018-01-17

= Changes =
 * Support for additional zynq platform Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC (Xilinx ZCU102, ARMv8a, Cortex A53)
 * Support for multiboot2 bootloaders on x86 (contributed change from Genode Labs)
 * Deprecate seL4_CapData_t type and functions related to it
 * A fastpath improvement means that when there are two runnable threads and the target thread is the highest priority 
in the scheduler, the fastpath will be hit. Previously the fastpath would not be used on IPC from a high priority 
thread to a low priority thread.
 * As a consequence of the above change, scheduling behaviour has changed in the case where a non-blocking IPC is sent 
between two same priority threads: the sender will be scheduled, rather than the destination.
 * Benchmarking support for armv8/aarch64 is now available.
 * Additional x86 extra bootinfo type for retrieving frame buffer information from multiboot 2 
 * Debugging option to export x86 Performance-Monitoring Counters to user level

= Upgrade notes =
 * seL4_CapData_t should be replaced with just seL4_Word. Construction of badges should just be `x` instead of
   `seL4_CapData_Badge_new(x)` and guards should be `seL4_CNode_CapData_new(x, y)` instead of
   `seL4_CapData_Guard_new(x, y)`
 * Code that relied on non-blocking IPC to switch between threads of the same priority may break.

7.0.0 2017-09-05

= Changes =
 * Support for building standalone ia32 kernel added
 * ia32: Set sensible defaults for FS and GS selectors
 * aarch64: Use tpidrro_el0 for IPC buffer instead of tpidr_el0
 * More seL4 manual documentation added for aarch64 object invocations
 * Default NUM_DOMAINS set to 16 for x86-64 standalone builds
 * libsel4: Return seL4_Error in invocation stubs in 8fb06eecff9 ''' This is a source code level breaking change '''
 * Add a CMake based build system
 * x86: Increase TCB size for debug builds
 * libsel4: x86: Remove nested struct declarations ''' This is a source code level breaking change '''
 * Bugfix: x86: Unmap pages when delete non final frame caps

= Upgrade notes =
 * This release is not source compatible with previous releases.
 * seL4 invocations that previously returned long now return seL4_Error which is an enum. Our libraries have already
   been updated to reflect this change, but in other places where seL4 invocations are used directly, the return types
   will need to be updated to reflect this change.
 * On x86 some structs in the Bootinfo have been rearranged. This only affects seL4_VBEModeInfoBlock_t which is used if
   VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE) information is being used.

= Known issues =
 * One of our tests is non-deterministicly becoming unresponsive on the SMP release build on the Sabre IMX.6 platform,
   which is a non verified configuration of the kernel.  We are working on fixing this problem, and will likely do a
   point release once it is fixed.
