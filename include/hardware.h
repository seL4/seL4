 *  - USER_TOP: The first address after the end of user memory
 *
 *  - PADDR_BASE: The first physical address mapped in the kernel's
 *    physical memory window.
 *  - PPTR_BASE: The first virtual address of the kernel's physical
 *    memory window.
 *  - PPTR_TOP: The first virtual address after the end of the kernel's
 *    physical memory window.
 *
 *  - KERNEL_ELF_PADDR_BASE: The first physical address used to map the
 *    initial kernel image. The kernel ELF is mapped contiguously
 *    starting at this address.
 *  - KERNEL_ELF_BASE: The first virtual address used to map the initial
 *    kernel image.
 *
 *  - KDEV_BASE: The first virtual address used to map devices.
