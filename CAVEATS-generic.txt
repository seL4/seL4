This file lists known caveats in the seL4 API and implementation.

* Implementation Correctness

Only the ARMv7 version on the imx6 platform of seL4 has a correctness proof.
This proof covers the functional behaviour of the C code of the kernel. It
does not cover machine code, compiler, linker, boot code, cache and TLB
management. Compiler and linker can be removed from this list by additionally
running the binary verification phase of the proof. The proof shows that the
seL4 C code implements the abstract API specification of seL4, and that this
specification satisfies the following high-level security properties:
  * integrity (no write without authority), 
  * confidentiality (no read without authority), and
  * intransitive non-interference (isolation between adequately 
    configured user-level components).

The security property proofs depend on additional assumptions on the correct
configuration of the system.


* Real Time

This version of seL4 is not a real-time kernel. It has a small number of
potentially long-running kernel operations that are not preemptible (e.g.,
endpoint deletion and recycling, scheduling, frame and CNode initialisation).
This may change in future versions.


* Recycle Operation

The Recycle operation will not necessarily reset all aspects of an object to
its initial state. For instance, Recycle for a badged endpoint capability will
only cancel messages with this badge. Recycle for a page directory will not
revoke all installed page caps, it will only unmap them. For the precise
behaviour see the specification.


* IPC buffer in globals frame may be stale

When a thread invokes its own TCB object to (re-)register its IPC buffer and
the thread is re-scheduled immediately, the userland IPC buffer pointer in the
globals frame may still show the old value. It is updated on the next thread
switch.


* Re-using Address Spaces (ARM and x86):

Before an ASID/page directory/page table can be reused, all frame caps
installed in it should be revoked. The kernel will not do this automatically
for the user.

If, for instance, page cap c is installed in the address space denoted by a
page directory under ASID A, and the page directory is subsequently revoked or
deleted, and then a new page directory is installed under that same ASID A,
the page cap c will still retain some authority in the new page directory,
even though the user intention might be to run the new page directory under a
new security context. The authority retained is to perform the unmap operation
on the page the cap c refers to.
