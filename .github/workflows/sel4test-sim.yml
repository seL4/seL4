# To reduce the load we cancel any older runs of this workflow for the current
# PR. Such runs exist, if there were new pushes to the PR's branch without
# waiting for the workflow to finish. As a side effect, pushing new commits now
# becomes a convenient way to cancel all the older runs, e.g. if they are stuck
# and would only be stopped by the timeout eventually.
