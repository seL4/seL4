{SchedContext - UnbindObject}
{Unbind an object from a scheduling context. The object can be either a thread or a notification.

If the thread being unbound is the thread that is bound to this scheduling context, this will render the thread passive, see \autoref{sec:passive}. However if the thread being unbound received the scheduling context via scheduling context donation over IPC, the scheduling context will be returned to the thread that it was originally bound to.

If the object is a notification and it is bound to the scheduling context, unbind it.
