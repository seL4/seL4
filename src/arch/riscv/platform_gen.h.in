/*
 * seL4 assigns all IRQs global interrupt numbers that are used in interrupt
 * invocations. On RISC-V we have 3 different types of interrupts: core timer,
 * core software generated, and global external IRQs delivered through the PLIC.
 * Only global external interrupts are available from user level and so it is
 * nice to be able to match PLIC IRQ numbers to seL4 IRQ numbers. The PLIC uses
 * IRQ 0 to refer to no IRQ pending and so we can also use 0 for irqInvalid in
 * the global IRQ number space and not have any aliasing issues. We then place
 * the kernel timer interrupts after the last PLIC interrupt and intend on
 * placing software generated interrupts after this in the future. As the kernel
 * timer and SGI interrupts are never seen outside of the kernel, it doesn't
 * matter what number they get assigned to as we can refer to them by their enum
 * field name.
