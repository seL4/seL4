 * The following assumes familiarity with RISC-V interrupt delivery and the PLIC.

 * include/plat/spike/plat/machine.h for more information.
 * RISC-V IRQ handling on seL4 works as follows:
 *
 * On other architectures the kernel masks interrupts between delivering them to
 * userlevel and receiving the acknowledgment invocation. This strategy doesn't
 * work on RISC-V as an IRQ is implicitly masked when it is claimed, until the
 * claim is acknowledged. If we mask and unmask the interrupt at the PLIC while
 * a claim is in progress we sometimes experience IRQ sources not being masked
 * and unmasked as expected. Because of this, we don't mask and unmask IRQs that
 * are for user level, and also call plic_complete_claim for seL4_IRQHandler_Ack.
